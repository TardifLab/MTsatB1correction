### This MATLAB code is designed to generate a correction curve to be able to correct MTsat for B1 errors. 
#### Requirements:
    - MTsat data (MT-weighted image, low flip angle and high flip angle image)
    - relative B1 map (where the prescribed B1 value == 1)
    - Load/Save MRI data: https://github.com/ulrikls/niak (If you use other code, you will just need to change the load and save functions)
    - For datafitting: poltfitn toolbox https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/34765-polyfitn
    - and get equation from https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/9577-symbolic-polynomial-manipulation
##### Optional code to improve* image quality:
    - Denoising Matlab code: https://github.com/sunenj/MP-PCA-Denoising
    - Unring code: https://github.com/josephdviviano/unring)
    - Note* the sample data was already processed with the denoising and unringing code. 

#### General Steps:
    1. Simulate  the sequence with known timing and saturation parameters. 
         -> as in simSeq_M0b_R1obs.m
    2. Generate MTsat and R1 values for 1 subject, making sure all flip angles used in the calculation are modified for relative B1. (flip angle achieved = flip angle prescribed at scanner multiplied by the B1map value). 
         -> as in sampleCode_calc_M0bappVsR1.m
    3. Fit the simulation results to the MTsat dataset to solve for M0B,app
         -> as in sampleCode_calc_M0bappVsR1.m
    4. Correlate M0B,app with the R1 values used in the fit. 
         -> as in sampleCode_calc_M0bappVsR1.m
    5. Be sure that the results of step 2 and 4 stored to a fitResults structure
         -> as in sampleCode_calc_M0bappVsR1.m
    6. Now you are able to correct future MTsat data using this imaging protocol.
         -> as in sample_code_correct_MTsat.m

Note that many of the calculations in step 6 are repeated from the previous script. 
This is intended as steps 2-5 should only need to be completed on one dataset
for a given imaging protocol. Then the fit results can be reused for step 6
in subsequent datasets. 

Code included in PCA folder is used to recreate figures from paper, but is not needed for B1 correction of data. 

** Note the parts of the code will need to be modified for use.
- Matlab code files are broken up into sections. Generally, code that needs 
to be adjusted is placed towards the top of the section.
