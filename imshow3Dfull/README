Code to allow you to visualize your 3D MRI data in matlab. 

Original function taken from https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/41334-imshow3d (see license in this folder). 
This function was modified such that the optional 3rd argument is the colourmap for display (such as 'jet'). By default it will display in greyscale. 

imshow3dseg.m is a modification of this code to permit the overlay of a segmentation ontop of a 3D image. Image will be displayed in greyscale, with the segmentation showing in a green line.
